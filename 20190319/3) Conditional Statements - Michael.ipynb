    "Conditional statements are used in code to do different things based on the condition of a variable.  This allows you to do different things based on different input.  Conditional statements are tested once and they run in the order that they are written.\n",
    "\n",
    "Types of conditional statements:\n",
    "- **\"if\"** - use to check if a condition is true, then runs indented block of code\n",
    "- **\"elif\"** - must follow an \"if\" statement, if the above \"if\" statement is false, the \"elif\" statement will be checked\n",
    "- **\"else\"** - must follow an \"if\" or \"elif\" statement, used as a catch-all if none of the above statements are found to be true\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of a conditional statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "x = 50\n",
    "if x > 50:\n",
    "    print('x is greater than 50')\n",
    "elif x < 50:\n",
    "    print('x is less than 50')\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    print('x is equal to 50')\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Constructing a conditional statement:\n",
    "- start with one of the three condition types (if, elif, else)\n",
    "- for \"if\" and \"elif\", write a statement using operators that checks the condition of a variable\n",
    "- the first line of a conditional statement ends in a colon (\":\")\n",
    "- the action for the condition is indented (4 spaces)\n",
    "    - i.e. indented code runs when the condition is found to be true"
