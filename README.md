Course Description
------------------

This course is designed for non-programmers, biologists, or those without specific knowledge of Python to learn how to program.
Week by week, we will slowly build up your skills and understanding of computer programming and the Python programming language.
There will be in-class demonstrations, using [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/features/) and to a lesser extent [JupyterLab](http://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), and activities to be completed outside of class, using [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com), for you to practice and learn at your own pace.

Learning Objectives
-------------------

By the end of this course you should be able to:
1. Look at a task and determine if you can or should automate it
2. Create working Python programs
3. Understand the difference between Python object types (e.g. lists, dicts)
4. Perform data analysis and visualization with Python
5. Use [git](https://git-scm.com/) for version control and collaboration
6. Demonstrate your Python skills with a project

Communication
------------

**Before contacting us**, please check to see if your question has already been answered elsewhere, e.g. [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/).

If you cannot find the answer, please make sure to ask your question thoughtfully (https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask) and provide everything needed to answer e.g. code, error message, dataset, etc.

In general, please use the [course Slack workspace](https://biof309.slack.com) to communicate with classmates and instructors. If you have a course-relevant question or something to share, [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) is simply better than email. In case of personal/private question/concerns, please use [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) direct message (DM).

In case of an emergency, please send a DM on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com) *and* an email.

Logistics
---------

This is a one-semester course starting on the 5th of February 2019 and finishing on ??th of May 2019.

**Class Location: Room 162, Building 60, NIH Bethesda campus**

Attendance in class is strongly recommended; however, we realize other commitments may occasionally prevent attendance. If you miss a class, please review the materials available at the course [GitHub repository](https://github.com/biof309/spring2019) and keep up with activities and homework.

We will be offering REMOTE ATTENDANCE and CLASS RECORDINGS via [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeet.me/biof309) and [WebEx](https://cbiit.webex.com/join/skarzynskimw). These two options are largely the same, you can pick whichever platform you prefer. Please do **NOT** use this as excuse to skip class and just watch the recorded lectures! This course is **NOT** a Massive Online Open Course (MOOC), it will feature a great deal of group work. Additionally, forming groups to complete the final project is highly encouraged! Remote attendance will work best if you can meet with classmates to work through exercises together. We will do our best to answers questions in the [GoToMeeting](https://www.gotomeet.me/biof309) and [WebEx](https://cbiit.webex.com/join/skarzynskimw) chat windows during class. We will also try to answer all questions on [Slack](https://biof309.slack.com), but please try to ask your questions during class, if at all possible.
