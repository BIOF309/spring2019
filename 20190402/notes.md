# Post-Class Notes

* work through a dataset immediately (gapminder)
* stress thinking in vectors
	* loops are a problem, avoid (slow)
	* [CUT LOOPS and VECTORIZE!!! - read this](https://engineering.upside.com/a-beginners-guide-to-optimizing-pandas-code-for-speed-c09ef2c6a4d6)
	* use the vectorization of NumPy!
* problem-oriented lesson, work in groups
	* form script that outputs new dataframe
	* output plots
	* clean's data
* maybe 1 hour of lesson, then 1 hour of group work
	* lesson to cover the basics
	* get into groupby(), unique(), sort_values() immediately
* think about discussing StaticFrame
	* [TalkPython - StaticFrame](https://talkpython.fm/episodes/show/204/staticframe-like-pandas-but-safer)
	* summary: immutable dataframes, running all on numpy
